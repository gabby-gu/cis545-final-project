*ðŸŽ¹ CIS 5450 Final Project: Spotify Song Genres ðŸŽ¹*

**Will Cai, Kavya Ravishankar, Gabby Gu**


What are the defining characteristics of a musical genre? Given the musical elements of a song such as tempo, key, energy level, and more, can we predict what the genre will be?

Our project goal is to analyze that question using Kaggle's Spotify Huge Database which includes information on songs from various genres over a period of three years.

We will use machine learning and data analysis techniques to identify patterns and correlations between the musical characteristics of songs and their associated genres. In essence, the project seeks to uncover the key factors that distinguish one genre from another and explore the feasibility of creating a predictive model for genre classification.
